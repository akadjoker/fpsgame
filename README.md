# FPS From Scratch (C++ / Raylib)

A small **first-person shooter prototype** built almost entirely from scratch.  
This is a **learning & passion project**: no big frameworks, no shortcuts – just custom rendering, collision, and animation systems written by hand using C++.

##  Project Goals
- Break the routine and get back into **low-level game programming**
- Practice **C++** and systems design
- Build core engine components from scratch while keeping things fun

##  Features (so far)
- **Custom rendering pipeline** using OpenGL through Raylib  
- **Custom shaders** for basic effects (lighting, water, reflections)  
- **FPS-style camera and movement**  
- Precise **collision system** (ellipsoid + sliding)  
- Basic **animation system** with weapon and player attachments  
- Clean, modular structure (designed to grow into a small engine)

##  Next Steps
- Add simple AI for NPCs  
- Extend the shader system with post-processing effects  

- Start building actual gameplay features  

 

##  Tech Stack
- **C++17**
- **Raylib** (for window/input/GL bindings)
- **OpenGL** (custom rendering)
